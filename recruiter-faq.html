I'm strongly biased towards software-as-a-service products. In other words, the main source of revenue for the company should be from the software. Also, I'm not interested in ad-tech. I am more interested in developer tools, and fintech. B-Corps, and non-profits are also given preference, regardless of their product or service.</div></div><div class="mb-4"><div class="fs-5 mb-2">What do you look for in a company?</div><div class="fs-6 ms-5">I'm looking for a place where people enjoy working at, and where they're all given the mentorship to grow in their own directions. Work-life balance for everyone is important, and so is using the latest software engineering practices. I also care about continual process improvement.</div></div><div class="mb-4"><div class="fs-5 mb-2">What kind of software development would you like to do next?</div><div class="fs-6 ms-5">If I'll be working on a web app, I would like to stick to full-stack. If the backend work is intensive, then backend-only is fine. I am open to working in other programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Rust. I'd like to avoid Java, C#, and PHP.</div></div><div class="mb-4"><div class="fs-5 mb-2">Do you have a portfolio?</div><div class="fs-6 ms-5">I do have a
