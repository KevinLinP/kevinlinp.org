        .fs-5.mb-2 What is your work status?
        .fs-6.ms-5 I am a US citizen.

      .mb-4
        .fs-5.mb-2 Which locations are you interested in?
        .fs-6.ms-5 100% remote, Washington DC metro, Bay Area, San Diego, Seattle, and Portland. Europe also, I'm actively searching there, the working language would have to be English.

      .mb-4
        .fs-5.mb-2 Which industries are you interested in?
        .fs-6.ms-5 The specific industry doesn't matter as much as what I'm working on. I'm strongly biased towards software-as-a-service products. In other words, the main source of revenue for the company should be from the software. Also, I'm not interested in ad-tech. I am more interested in developer tools, and fintech. B-Corps, and non-profits are also given preference, regardless of their product or service.

      .mb-4
        .fs-5.mb-2 What do you look for in a company?
        .fs-6.ms-5 I'm looking for a place where people enjoy working at, and where they're all given the mentorship to grow in their own directions. Work-life balance for everyone is important, and so is using the latest software engineering practices. I also care about continual process improvement.

      .mb-4
        .fs-5.mb-2 What kind of software development would you like to do next?
        .fs-6.ms-5 If I'll be working on a web app, I would like to stick to full-stack. If the backend work is intensive, then backend-only is fine. I am open to working in other programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, and Rust. I'd like to avoid Java, C#, and PHP.
